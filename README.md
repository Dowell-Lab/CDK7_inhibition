-- OV90 PRO-seq contains the data associated with GSE228346.
This data is PRO-seq data generated from OV90 cells treated +/- SY-5609 CDK7 inhibitor for 30min, then was heat shocked at 42C for 0min, 20min or 45min.
See the experimental design figure below.

-- HCT116 PRO-seq contains the data associated with GSE261575.
This data is PRO-seq data generated from HCT116 cells treated +/- SY-5609 CDK7 inhibitor for 30min, then was treated with IFNg for 45min.
There is also data +/- Palbociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor) with a 30min treatment.

-- OV90 RNA-seq contains two subfolders.
1) HS dataset contains the data associated with GSE228346.
This data is RNA-seq data generated from OV90 cells treated +/- SY-5609 inhibitor for 30min, then was heat shocked at 42C for 0min, 30min or 120min. The 30min dataset has a 30min recovery before the mRNA was harvestd via polyA selection.
See the experimental design figure below.
2) Long exposure SY-5609 contains the data associated with GSE262536.
This data is a RNA-seq data set prepared separately from the HS data set. In this experimental design OV90 cells were treated with 40nm or 400nm SY-5609 for 4hr before mRNA harvest.

Note that the alternative CDK7 inhibitiors SY-5102 and 3MBPP1 were not included in this study.
